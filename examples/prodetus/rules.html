To prevent those trolls from taking your candy, we have a team of dedicated staff members that enforce the rules that we have established :D, but they aren't on 24/7 meaning that sometimes our staff cannot handle a dispute right then and there, and we ask you to respect such rules, and report those that don't. Such rules enlisted in the 'General Rules section apply not only to our in-game community but to our forum community as well. The rules listed should just be common sense, and pretty much describes what 90% of all minecraft servers/networks ask you not to do.</center></font></p>
