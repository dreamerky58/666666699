		<p><font size="3">Our network would never be able to grow, in regards to the population of the server, gamemodes, and security if it wasn't for our staff. As our community begins to grow, then we'll constantly breech out and seek new staff members to be added to the team. The more staff members we have the easier it is for us to maintain a clean environment in regards to hacking, swearing, etc. Of course, we aren't going to over power the community with the tyrannical power the staff have :P, which is why we go through a quick interview with users we've considered to ensure the application contains legitimate information. The amount of staff we choose to recruit, depends on the average number of players on our network, staff applications are objected to close with or without notice to review current ones. During those times, you are NOT allowed to apply. Also note that certain times we find users who seem as they are dedicated, and mature individuals. Due to this, staff may be selected manually under the consent of the Administrators.<br/><br/>
		Our staffing system may seem a bit different in comparison to other servers you've been on. Due to the fact our network having a variety of gamemodes, the administrators have decided that the newly recruited staff members, get divided into moderating a specific portion of the server. Sr. Mods, and Administrators are staff across the entire network, while moderators, and Jr. Mods are divided accordingly. Forum-wise, they can moderate the entire board.
		If done, properly and legitimately, the application process should be a breeze, under the fact that you've followed the format, and meet the specific requirements, found below. If you meet the requirements, proceed into the application process.<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>You must be 13+*</li>
			<li>Able to follow directions given by an Administrator/Sr. Staff</li>
			<li>Have a professional manner when dealing with a user(s)</li>
			<li>Stay calm and peaceful when something is directed against you.</li>
			<li>Be willing to attend IRC meetings to discuss certain situations/ideas (We normally hold such events once a month)</li>
		</ul> <br/>
		Please send an email to jobs@prodetus.net when applying for a staff position. If your application has been accepted, we'll send you a response within 48 hours. We don't reply to applicants that haven't been accepted, but don't fret about it since we keep applications for further reviewing in the future, and may get back to you sooner or later.<br/><br/>
