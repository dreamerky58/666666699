Thanks for downloading my resource 'Prodetus', it means a lot.

I'd appreciate it if you could give credit to me, somewhere.
Donating would also be nice, message me on Spigot if you are considering it.

This update introduces new features:

1) Now responsive!
2) Major code cleanup. No more messy code!
3) Staff page now in compliance.
4) .html extension removed (DO NOT MODIFY THE .htaccess)

If you need support, feel free to message me on Spigot.

Thanks!
